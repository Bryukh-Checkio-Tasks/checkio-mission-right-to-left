    One of robots got the simple task -- to join a sequence of strings in one sentence.
    But this robot is left-hander and wants to joke. Let's help to do this.
</p>
<p>
    You are given a sequence of strings. You should to join these strings in one text,
    where initial strings are separated by commas.
    And for joke you should replace all words "right" to "left", even if it's a part of a word.
    All strings are given in lowercase.
</p>


<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A sequence of strings as a tuple of strings (unicode).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The text as a string.
</p>



<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
left_join(("left", "right", "left", "stop")) == "left,left,left,stop"
left_join(("bright aright", "ok")) == "bleft aleft,ok"
left_join(("brightness wright",)) == "bleftness wleft"
left_join(("enough", "jokes")) == "enough,jokes"
    </pre>
